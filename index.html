        <h3> Structuring content</h3>
            <p> header is the introductory content at the top of the page.</p>
            <p> footer is the ending of the website.</p>
            <p> main is element that is the main content of the page. Only used once to tell the browser where the main content.</p>
            <p> section is used to wrap around related pieces of content. each section usually has its own heading.</p>
            <p> article is an element that is a containted composition in a web page wich is intended to be distributable or reusable.</p>
            <p> nav is the element that represents a part of a page whose job it is to provide navigation links to other parts of the document or other documents.</p>

        <h3> Linking to an element on the same page</h3>
            <p> linking an element on the same page requires you have a section id on a part of the page. Lets say we are linking to a gallery portion of a website, we would give it the section id="gallery",
                and then we would begin our linking. We would then use the "a" tool to link it. So we would do 
                "a href="#gallery"> Gallery /a "
            </p>
        <h3> Commenting code</h3>
         <p> commenting is used to just comment your code, and will not display on your browser. They are used by just using pointy brackets and ! and writing your comments in between the brackets. </p>
        <h3> Landmark roles</h3>
            <p> Landmark roles are used to help people using screen readers jump to specific sections in websites.</p>
            <p> role="banner" is used to define an element as the header. Added to the primary header. </p>
            <p> role="navigation" is used to define an element as the primary navigation. Added to the top nav.</p>
            <p> role="main" is used to define an element as the main content of the page. Added to the main</p>
            <p> role="complimentary" is used to define an element as being content related to the primary content. Added to an aside</p>
            <p> role="contentinfo" is used to defininf an element as information about the content like copyright, terms, privacy policy etc. Added to a footer.</p>
            <h3>Skip links</h3>
            <p> skip links are put at the top of a page and is a way for users to jump to certain areas of the page. This is used the same way as linking an element on the same page but instead of using a section we would use nav or main to jump to them.</p>
